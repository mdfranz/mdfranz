I'm using this account again but a lot is over on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/mdfranz) also see my blog at [Medium](https://blog.mdfranz.com) and my [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewdfranz/)

See [gitlab commits](https://gitlab.com/users/mdfranz/activity) where I maintain some a knowledge base aka my personal awesome lists. 

I don't speak or write like I used to in the 2000's but [here](https://github.com/mdfranz/pubs) are some links to past public work in Security, Cloud, and ICS besides what is on my blog. 

I'm on Mastodon on multiple servers:
- [AWS Community](https://awscommunity.social/@mdfranz) - getting more active here
- [InfoSec Exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@mdfranz) - pretty active here as lots of folks moved over from Twitter
- [IOS Exchange](https://ioc.exchange/@mdfranz) - I mostly consume news and non-tech content here.
